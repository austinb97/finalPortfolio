Applying these principles to web design allows us to make sites that are truly great. Web sites that utilize these principles have increased form and function, which keeps users coming back and improves traffic.",

I also learned that creating site maps and wireframes helps develop the information architecture and maximizes the usefulness of the app layout. Learning how to properly plan, execute, and analyze tests on a prototype has also helped me design mobile layouts that are more user friendly.",

		"description":"My design guide for a fully responsive web site is a lot more in depth than the mobile guide. Creating a concept model gave me a good idea as to what I wanted my site to contain and what pages and sections would be required. After I knew what content I wanted, going through the PostIt information architecture exercise helped me better organize that content to provide a user with the most complete and fulfilling experience. I also discovered through the wireframes and surface comps that designing a responsive site takes a lot more consideration to how elements like the navigation will change with screen sizes. I found it easier to adapt my website as I went through those than it would be to have to go back in and rewrite code.",

These sites change and adapt according to the user's screen size and device to maximize usability for all devices. This includes changing navigation and eliminating hover elements on smartphones and tablets, while keeping the content and theme static and beautiful. Responsive design is very important because more people than ever are using mobile devices as their primary browser and we want to make sure they have a great experience.",

		"description":"SCSS has been my favorite thing I've learned so far in my web development education. This CSS preprocessor allows me to create variables and functions in my stylesheets, and better organize styles through nesting and partials. These elements help me build websites faster and easier than I ever could before. This project also includes elements available through GreenSock. GSAP is very useful in creating subtle animations that make a website seem more professional. I love adding these little details to sites in order to provide user's with an even better experience.",

		"description":"I designed and developed this website for Summit Primary Care, a local medical office. This has been a great opportunity for me to get first-hand experience working with clients to build a site that meets all their requirements. A challenge I faced with this project was making sure all the content the clients wanted was displayed effectively across all devices. I approached and solved this problem by using icons for social media links as well as phone call links on mobile devices. Content also gets reorganized across devices to provide a smooth flowing experience for all users. While working on this project, it was very important to me that I find the right balance between creating something modern and beautiful while still maintaining the maturity and professionalism that should represent a medical clinic. Acquiring professional experience as an independent web designer and developer before I'm even halfway through my degree has been amazing and I am so grateful to have had this opportunity.",
